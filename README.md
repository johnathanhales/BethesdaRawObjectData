# BethesdaRawObjectData
Just a collection of data files that I use for the Torvus line.

This collection of files was compiled from the respective Creation Kits that are available for each game.

Fallout 4 - Creation Kit (Bethesda Launcher edition)
Skyrim - Creation Kit (Steam edition)
Oblivion - The Elder Scrolls Construction Kit (Oblivion edition)
Fallout 3 - The Garden of Eden Creation Kit
Fallout: New Vegas The Garden of Eden Creation Kit (NV Edition)

This repo contains excel sheets of all the data, as well as the raw text dumps.
